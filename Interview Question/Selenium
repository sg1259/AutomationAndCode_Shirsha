16) Why strings are immutable? 
 17) What is string constant pool? 
 18) When int a = 20; 
int b = a ;  
System.out.println(a); -> o/p - 20
System.out.println(b); -> o/p - 20
a=30; 
System.out.println(a); -> o/p - 30
System.out.println(b); -> o/p - 20

But when we do same operation in HashMaps

Map<String, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
map1.put(“value”, 25);

Map<String, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();

map1=map2;

System.out.println(map1); -> o/p - value,25
System.out.println(map2); -> o/p - 20 - value,25

Now if we update this to - 
map1.put(“value”, 42)

System.out.println(map1); -> o/p - value,42
System.out.println(map2); -> o/p - 20 - value,42

Why does this happen??

19) Why do you need Throw and Throws keyword when we have Try,catch and finally? 
20) What are different locators? Why id locator is preferred? 
21) Explain Smoke vs Sanity vs Regression differences?
